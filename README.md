Problem 4: Modular Program Design
Description
Create a program using multiple functions to solve a larger problem â€” for example, a simple library management system with functions to add books, search for a book, and display the inventory. Ensure each functionality is handled by a separate function and is called from a main program.

Example
1. Add Book
2. Search Book
3. Display Inventory
4. Exit

Output (after a few operations):

Inventory :
- Book : Title - Author
- Book : Title - Author
- Book : Title - Author
